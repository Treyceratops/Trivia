<!-- - define questions/answers, correct/incorrect count, current idx, score, win/lose count -->
<!-- - cache divs by id -->
<!-- - display question and link corresponding answer -->
<!-- - add event listener to button to check input's value to see if (input.value === answer), adjusts correct/incorrect answers, brings up next question (QUESTIONS[idx++]), next answer (ANSWERS[idx++]) -->
<!-- - delete input's value after clicking submit -->
<!-- - input.value methods on event listener (.toLowerCase, .trim) -->
- display updated scores
<!-- - display previous questions info -->
<!-- - set win/lose conditions if (score >= winCondition#) then display win, else if (score >= loseCondition#) then display loss  -->
<!-- - resetGame by calling init() -->
